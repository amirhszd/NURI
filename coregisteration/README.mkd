# Coregistration

WORK IN PROGRESS.
this package is used for lab data VNIR and SWIR registration. It contains two modules:

* Automatic coregistration: this could be used when both VNIR and SWIR data have visible enough features in them. SIFT identifies the tie points.
* Manual coregistration: this could be used in whether there is small or large number of features available. The user identifies the tie points.
