# Coregistration

WORK IN PROGRESS.
this package is used for lab VNIR and SWIR data registration. It contains two main modules:

* Automatic coregistration (`coregisteration/coregister_sift_gui.py`): this could be used when both VNIR and SWIR data have visible enough features in them. SIFT identifies the tie points.
* Manual coregistration(`coregisteration/coregister_controlpoints_gui.py`): this could be used in whether there is small or large number of features available. The user identifies the tie points.
